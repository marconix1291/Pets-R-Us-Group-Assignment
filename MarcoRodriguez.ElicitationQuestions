#Sheridan Dela Cruz's Response as a Product Owner

1: Will customers be required to pay a deposit online when booking these new services, or will they pay entirely in the store?

Pets‑R‑Us will require customers to pay a small deposit online when booking grooming, training, or boarding services. 
The remaining balance will be paid in-store at the time of service. The deposit helps reduce no‑shows and ensures customers commit to their appointment slot. 
Deposit amounts may differ by service type based on duration and resource requirements, but the overall policy is consistent across the platform.

2: Do users need to create a permanent account to book an appointment, or can they use a quick guest checkout option?

Customers will be able to book appointments using either a full account or a guest checkout option.
Account users can save pet profiles, view past appointments, rebook quickly, and receive personalized recommendations.
Guest checkout allows first‑time or infrequent customers to book without friction, requiring only essential contact and pet information.

3: Are there specific capacity limits or different time block rules for grooming versus training versus boarding?

Each service Pets‑R‑Us offers has unique operational constraints that the booking system must support:
Grooming — Capacity depends on the number of groomers and grooming stations. Appointment lengths vary by service type (e.g., full groom vs. bath‑only), so time blocks must be configurable.
Training — Private sessions follow trainer availability, while group classes have fixed start times and strict class-size limits.
Boarding — Capacity is based on kennel availability, pet size, and length of stay. Boarding uses calendar‑based availability rather than hourly scheduling.

4: What is the official business policy if a customer needs to cancel or reschedule their appointment online?

Pets‑R‑Us will allow customers to cancel or reschedule up to 24 hours before their appointment without penalty. The deposit will be credited toward a future booking.
If a customer cancels within 24 hours of their appointment, the deposit is forfeited. Rescheduling within the 24‑hour window is allowed, 
but the deposit remains non‑refundable and is applied to the new appointment.

5: What is the primary metric you will use to measure the success of this new online booking feature?

The primary metric for evaluating success will be the online booking conversion rate—the percentage of users who start the booking flow and complete an appointment. 
This metric directly reflects usability, clarity, and customer trust in the new system.

Supporting metrics include:
Reduction in no‑show rates (due to deposits)
Percentage of total bookings made online vs. phone/in‑store
Repeat booking rate
Customer satisfaction with the booking experience
Operational efficiency improvements 


#Megan Mosier Responding to Elicitation Questions as Product Owner

1: Will customers be required to pay a deposit online when booking these new services, or will they pay entirely in the store?
We would like our customers to have a card on file to pre-authorize their services, with the charges only clearing after pick up.

2: Do users need to create a permanent account to book an appointment, or can they use a quick guest checkout option? 
In order to better service our guests and for the safety of our staff, we would like all animals to be registered through the website.  For payment of service, the user can either check out as a guest or they can use their created account for a more personalized transaction experience.

3: Are there specific capacity limits or different time block rules for grooming versus training versus boarding? 
We don’t currently have separate capacity limits or time block rules defined for grooming, training, and boarding. 

4: What is the official business policy if a customer needs to cancel or reschedule their appointment online? 
If a customer needs to cancel an appointment outside of the 24-hour time frame from the appointment they may do so.  If they cancel or reschedule within 24 hours of their appointment there will be a 15% cancellation fee.

5: What is the primary metric you will use to measure the success of this new online booking feature? 
The primary metric for success with be the percentage of appointments booked online rather and in-person or over the phone. This will tell us if customers are adopting the new feature and tell us if this is reducing the manual scheduling load that our staff takes on.
