# 1. What problem are you trying to solve, and how are you solving it today?
Right now, customers cannot book grooming, training, or boarding appointments online. Everything is handled through phone calls or in‑person visits, which leads to long wait times, scheduling mistakes, and a lot of extra work for our staff. Customers want a more convenient way to book services, especially outside store hours.
We want to solve this by adding a dependable online appointment system to our website. Customers should be able to log in, register their pets, see real‑time availability, and book services without needing to call the store.

# 2. What does success look like six months after this system is live?
Six months after launch, we want most grooming, training, and boarding appointments to be booked online. Customers should be using their accounts regularly to manage their pets and appointments, and our staff should see fewer interruptions from scheduling calls.
We also expect fewer booking errors, smoother daily operations, and an increase in service usage because the process is easier. If customers tell us the system is simple and convenient, that will be a strong sign of success.

# 3. Who else is affected by this process that we haven't spoken to yet?
Several groups will be affected. Our groomers, trainers, and boarding staff rely on accurate schedules to plan their day, so their input matters. The front‑desk team will also be impacted because they currently handle all appointment calls.
Marketing will need to keep service descriptions and promotions updated on the site. Operations or IT support will be involved in maintaining the system once it is live. And of course, our customers, especially those with multiple pets, will depend on this new experience.

# 4. What are the things that absolutely cannot break or go wrong?
The scheduling process must be completely reliable. Double bookings, incorrect time slots, or missing information would create major issues for both customers and staff.
Customer login and pet profiles also need to work consistently, since they are central to the booking process. Real‑time availability must always be accurate, and confirmation messages need to be sent without fail. The system also needs to stay stable during peak hours, because downtime would cause a lot of frustration.

# 5. If budget and time weren't constraints, what would the ideal version of this look like?
In an ideal world, we would have a fully integrated customer portal that includes pet health records, vaccination reminders, and a complete service history. A mobile app would be great so customers could book and manage appointments on the go.
We would also love automated scheduling tools that match pets with the best available staff, along with seamless integration with our POS, CRM, and inventory systems.
Personalized recommendations based on breed or past services would make the experience feel even more tailored. 
Overall, the goal would be a modern, highly personalized digital experience for pet owners.

1.	What problem are you trying to solve, and how are you solving it today?
We’re trying to reduce the manual workload and scheduling bottlenecks caused by over the phone and in-person bookings since it can be time consuming and prone to errors;

2. What does success look like six months after this system is live? 
Success looks like continuous adoption of the online booking system and a reduction of workload for our employees from booking and scheduling, and improvement to our customer experience.

3. Who else is affected by this process that we haven't spoken to yet? 
Our groomers, Trainers, and Boarding teams; Operational staff; Our Marketing team; Accounting and Finance team.

4. What are the things that absolutely cannot break or go wrong? 
We cannot have any customer data compromised.  If the scheduling system is impacted or does not work, we can fall back on our previous tactics but if we have any customer information get compromised we may not be able to recover from the trust lost.

5. If budget and time weren't constraints, what would the ideal version of this look like? 
The ideal version provides a booking platform that manages availability, capacity, and service rules automatically.  Our customers can schedule any service through an organized, intuitive interface that shows real-time openings and service details.  Our teams have a dashboard that updates in real-time, eliminating double booking and scheduling errors and auto adjusts based on staffing and booking capacity.
