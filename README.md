# Assignment: Pets-R-Us

Continuation of the previous scenario: Pets-R-Us is a local pet store that offers a variety of pets for adoption. Pets-R-Us also sells a variety of pet-related products, supplies, services, and accessories. Pets-R-Us needs help with the company website. Recently Pets-R-Us expanded into dog grooming, training, and boarding services. Because of these added business services, Pets-R-Us needs help expanding its current website to market these services. It would also like to offer customers the ability to make appointments for their dogs online. Pets-R-Us just completed and sent out a Request for Proposal (RFP) to expand its website. The RFP included a high priority requirement to design and develop online appointment-making functionality so that customers could log in and schedule their dog(s) to receive these services.

Instructions: As a group, complete this exercise. 

# Group Activity 1

One team member will assume the role of Product Owner representing the client, while the other team member assumes the UI designer/web developer role. In a team of three, the 3rd person will assume a Co-Product Owner role representing the Marketing function for the client.
Using the Pets-R-Us scenario as a reference, the developer must interview the Product Owner(s) to elicit and document a detailed list of three (3) or more user requirements in the form of user stories. The stories must be written in standard story format (As an x, I need y, so that z). NOTE: Requirement Elicitation Questions from the Reading & Videos section may help with the interview process.

The Product Owner(s) and developers should then switch roles so that everyone has a chance to serve in the developer role. NOTE: Two-person groups should generate six (6) or more user stories, while three-person groups would end up with nine (9) or more user stories.

The stories should then be ranked in priority order from 1 to n, with 1 being the highest priority.

# Group Activity 2

Using the ranked stories from Group Activity #1, break the top two stories down into at least five (5) tasks within each story.

With all team members serving in a designer/developer role, work together to estimate the size of each task and the overall story in hours and in points. Do this for both of the top two stories from your prioritized list.

Use the Planning Poker video as a reference for the points-based estimation process.

The online Planning Poker game facilitates the sizing process when teams are remotely located.

# Group Activity 3

Identify and agree on specific functionality within the Pets-R-Us site to use for this exercise.
Using requirements details learned from elicitation activities, each team member should create a wireframe design for the selected functionality (can be paper/pencil).

The team should review and exchange wireframes and compare notes.

Are there additional changes or adjustments that should be made to the final wireframe product now that these visualizations are available? Make any necessary refinements and agree upon the final version of the wireframe to represent the team. Any drawing tool may be used, as long as the result can be included in the final document.

Document any challenges the team faced or any lessons learned during each group activity.

# Deliverables
Note the names of each team member within the final assignment.

Combine all work products into one document and save to a .pdf prior to submission.

One team member can submit the assignment on behalf of the team, or each team member can submit a copy of the final assignment individually.
