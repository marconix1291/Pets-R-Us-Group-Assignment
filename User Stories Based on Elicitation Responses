Story 2: As a store manager, I need the system to require all customers to register their pet details before finalizing a booking, so that our staff is fully prepared for the specific size and needs of the animal arriving.

Story 3: As a product owner, I need the booking system to enforce unique capacity rules and time blocks for grooming, training, and boarding, so that we never overbook our physical kennel space or trainer availability.
