1. What does a successful outcome for this project look like for you?
A successful outcome means that the majority of our customers are booking their grooming, training, and boarding appointments online instead of calling the store. 
It also means our staff spends less time on the phone and more time taking care of the animals, and we completely eliminate the issue of double booking appointments.

2. What is happening today without this feature?
Right now, customers can only book appointments by calling us during business hours or walking into the store. 
Our staff has to write everything down in a paper planner and a basic spreadsheet, which takes a lot of time and leads to mistakes like accidentally booking two dogs for the same kennel space.

3. What is your desired timeline, and what is driving it?
Our goal is to have this system fully live and tested before the upcoming holiday season. 
The holidays are our busiest time for boarding, and we need this automated system in place to handle the surge in reservations without overwhelming our front desk staff.

4. Are there any budget constraints for this project?
Yes, since we just invested heavily in expanding our physical space for the new services, we have a strict budget for this digital expansion. 
We need to focus strictly on the core features, like the booking calendar and the double booking prevention, before we consider adding luxury features like a custom mobile app or live webcams.

5. Who will maintain this after the release?
Our internal IT coordinator will handle the day to day maintenance and troubleshooting. 
However, we are hoping to establish a continuous service contract with your development team to handle major updates, security patches, and the integration of any future features.

1. What does a successful outcome for this project look like for you?
A successful outcome is that the website clearly promotes the new grooming, training, and boarding services and allows customers to easily log in and book appointments online. 
If customers can self‑schedule without calling the store and staff see fewer manual scheduling tasks, then the project has achieved its goal.

2. What is happening today without this feature?
Right now, customers have to call or visit the store to book services, which creates extra work for staff and increases the chance of scheduling mistakes. 
The website also doesn’t effectively showcase the new services, so Pets‑R‑Us is missing opportunities to drive awareness and bookings.

3. What is your desired timeline, and what is driving it?
I’d like to see this delivered within the next 8–12 weeks. The business has already launched these services, 
and the website needs to support them as soon as possible so customers can book online and staff can reduce the time spent managing appointments manually.

4. Are there any budget constraints for this project?
Yes, we need to stay within a reasonable budget that fits a local business. 
That means focusing on the core needs—marketing the new services and enabling online scheduling—and being mindful of any third‑party tools or integrations that add cost.

5. Who will maintain this after the release?
Maintenance will be handled by the team responsible for the website, whether internal or external. 
They’ll manage updates and fixes, while I’ll oversee future enhancements and gather feedback from store staff and customers to guide improvements.
