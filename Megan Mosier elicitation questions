1. What does a successful outcome for this project look like for you?
A successful outcome means that the majority of our customers are booking their grooming, training, and boarding appointments online instead of calling the store. 
It also means our staff spends less time on the phone and more time taking care of the animals, and we completely eliminate the issue of double booking appointments.

2. What is happening today without this feature?
Right now, customers can only book appointments by calling us during business hours or walking into the store. 
Our staff has to write everything down in a paper planner and a basic spreadsheet, which takes a lot of time and leads to mistakes like accidentally booking two dogs for the same kennel space.

3. What is your desired timeline, and what is driving it?
Our goal is to have this system fully live and tested before the upcoming holiday season. 
The holidays are our busiest time for boarding, and we need this automated system in place to handle the surge in reservations without overwhelming our front desk staff.

4. Are there any budget constraints for this project?
Yes, since we just invested heavily in expanding our physical space for the new services, we have a strict budget for this digital expansion. 
We need to focus strictly on the core features, like the booking calendar and the double booking prevention, before we consider adding luxury features like a custom mobile app or live webcams.

5. Who will maintain this after the release?
Our internal IT coordinator will handle the day to day maintenance and troubleshooting. 
However, we are hoping to establish a continuous service contract with your development team to handle major updates, security patches, and the integration of any future features.
