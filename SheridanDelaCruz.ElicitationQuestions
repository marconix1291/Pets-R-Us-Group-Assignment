#Marco Rodriguez Responses as Product Owner
1. What is the main goal you want this system to achieve?
The main goal is to expand our digital presence to support our new grooming, training, and boarding services. 
We want to give customers the ability to easily schedule these services online at any time, which will increase our bookings and reduce the administrative burden on our staff.

2. Who will be using the system, and what will they need it for?
Our primary users are existing and new pet owners in the local community. 
They need a simple, user friendly way to log in, select the service they need for their dog, and pick an available date and time. 
Our store staff will also use the system to manage the daily schedule and view upcoming appointments.

3. What challenges or frustrations are you experiencing with the current system?
Currently, customers have to call us or visit the store to book an appointment. 
This is frustrating for them if they want to book outside of our normal business hours. 
For our staff, manually managing the schedule takes too much time away from helping customers in the store, and it increases the risk of double booking or missing an appointment.

4. Which features or functions are absolutely essential for you?
The absolutely essential features include a login portal for customers, a calendar interface to select dates and times, 
a dropdown to choose between grooming, training, or boarding, and a backend system that prevents double booking our staff and kennel space.

5. Are there any constraints we should keep in mind (budget, timeline, compliance)?
We have a strict deadline to launch this before the upcoming holiday rush, as boarding demand spikes during that time. 
We also need to make sure the system requires users to confirm their pets are up to date on vaccinations before they can finalize a boarding or training appointment.
