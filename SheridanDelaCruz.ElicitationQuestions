# Elicitation Questions – Pets-R-Us Project

1. What is the main goal you want this system to achieve?
2. Who will be using the system, and what will they need it for?
3. What challenges or frustrations are you experiencing with the current system?
4. Which features or functions are absolutely essential for you?
5. Are there any constraints we should keep in mind (budget, timeline, compliance)?

# Added my elicitation interview questions, feel free to answer them as a Product Owner. Thanks
